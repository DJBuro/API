Right mouse click on the "Custom" folder here and click "Open command prompt".
In the command propmt run "build" and then "devbuild".

Assuming you're using the standard source code locations the theme css files will be merged into a single "skin.css" file in your website "Custom" folder here:

C:\Andromeda Development Source\Rameses Web Components\WebSites\Andromeda.WebOrderingV2 DEV\Custom

This is essentially your local dev version of the custom folder on a real AndroWeb website (after it's been published).

Note that the files in this folder are NOT in TFS. They are your local copy that you can customise during development.

When doing a release you'll need to copy the "skin.css" file to the server into the appropriate c:\androwebordering\themes\<themeid> folder.
When you do a publish from MyAndromeda, your skin.css file will be deplyed to the websites folder.
