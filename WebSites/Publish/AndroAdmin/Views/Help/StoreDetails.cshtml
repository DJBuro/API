    <h3>Store ID, Store name, Store status, Country, Chain</h3>
    <p>See the “Add a store” help section.</p>

    <h3>Customer store ID</h3>
    <p>See the “Add a store” help section.</p>

    <h3>Customer store name</h3>
    <p>The “Customer store name” is the customers name for a store.  This may or may not be the same as our name for a store.  For example, we often prefix the store name with the chain name, e.g. “PapaJohns Bristol”.   Some chains may use completely different names for their stores than we do.</p>
    <p>If we don’t know the customers store name then either use the Andromeda store name or for a chain use our store name but consider removing the chain  name e.g. “Bristol” rather than “PapaJohns Bristol”.</p>

    <h3>External store ID</h3>
    <p>The “External store ID” is a special store id that is different from our Andromeda store id and the customers store id.  This id is exposed to outside companies such as online ordering web sites.  This number is usually automatically generated and shouldn’t be changed unless you have been specifically asked to.</p>

    <h3>External store name</h3>
    <p>The “External store name” is a special store name that can be different from our Andromeda store name and the customers store name.  This name is exposed to outside companies and may be displayed on online ordering web sites visible to end customers ordering food.  As end customers may see the name it should be a friendly name.  Please don’t change this without agreement by the store or chain.  </p>

    <h3>Store telephone number</h3>
    <p>The “Store telephone number” is the customer facing number used by members of the public to place orders directly with the store.  This is NOT the stores private number or managers mobile number.</p>

    <h3>Timezone</h3>
    <p>The “Timezone” is the international time zone that the store is located in.  For example, a UK store would be in the “GMT” time zone, a French store would be “GMT + 1”.  If in doubt, use Google to find out which time zone a country or city is in.</p>

    <h3>Web payment provider</h3>
    <p>The “Web payment provider” is the account details that online ordering web sites should use for the store.  The selected payment provider details will be used by the online ordering website to take payments for orders.  This might be datacash account details so that an payment taken for a web order would be made using the specified datacash account.</p>
    <p>Be very careful when setting this as we don’t want payments going to the wrong chain!!.</p>
